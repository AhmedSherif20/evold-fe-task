## About Libraries

I only installed [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) and [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages) anything else it's built-in in angular or in angular dependencies, I focused more on code structure and readability

## Reason of use Libraries

1. ng-bootstrap => make easy and fast and responsive layout
2. angular-cli-ghpages => to deployment app in github pages"
